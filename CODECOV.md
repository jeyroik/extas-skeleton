Go here to get codecov token:
https://codecov.io/gh/@user/extas-@package

After that create new secret with the name CODECOV_TOKEN here:
https://github.com/jeyroik/extas-api/settings/secrets/new

Value of the new secret - is your codecov token.

Tip: you can change a secret name to anything you want - for that change the secret name in the gihub workflow as well (see .github/workflows/php.yml).
